## What is data science?

*"Data science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of <font class="vocab">mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science</font>."*

## Meet your classmates!

(~ 7 minutes)

- Go to a breakout room

- Introduce yourself!
  - Name
  - Year
  - What is something you're looking forward to this semester (either in this class or in general)?

- I'll visit some of the breakout rooms.

- *The breakout rooms are not recorded.*

---

## Practice with Zoom 

--

- Display your name (first and last name)

--

- Raise your hand 

--

- Reactions

--

- Chat

--


- Poll 

--

- Breakout rooms (not recorded)

- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)


- Occasional articles and other readings posted on the course website


---

## Activities and assessments

--

- .vocab[Homework]: Individual assignments combining conceptual and computational skills. 

--

- .vocab[Labs]: Individual or team assignments focusing on computational skills. 

--

- .vocab[Exams]: Two take-home exams.

--

- .vocab[Final Project]: Team project presented during the final exam period.

--

- .vocab[Application Exercises]: Exercises worked on during the live lecture session.

--

- Use .vocab[Piazza] for general questions about course content and/or assignments, since other students may benefit from the response.

--

- Use email for questions regarding personal matters and/or grades.

---

## Lectures

- Focus on concepts behind data analysis

- Has two components:
  - **Lecture content videos** to watch before we meet
  - **Live lecture session** to ask questions and apply concepts from videos by working on exercises in small groups. 
  
- Ask questions by "raising your hand" or posting them in the chat. 

- I encourage you to use your video if you are comfortable. 
---

## Course community 

--

- Uphold the Duke Community Standard: 
> - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;

## Your Turn!

## Create a GitHub account

.instructions[
Go to https://github.com/, and create an account (unless you already have one). 

After you create your account, go to [bit.ly/sta199-github](https://bit.ly/sta199-github) and enter your Duke email address (NETID@duke.edu) and GitHub username. 
]

<small>
Some tips from [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice).
</small>

- <small>Incorporate your actual name!</small>
- <small> Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e.<small> g., Twitter or Slack.</small>
- <small> Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.</small>
- <small> Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. Shorter is better than longer.</small>
- <small> Make it timeless.</small>
- <small> Avoid words with special meaning in programming (e.g. `NA`).</small>

---

## Let's do an analysis!

- Let's take a look at the [UN Votes](https://sta199-fa20-002.netlify.app/appex/appex01-unvotes.html) analysis.

--

- Talk about the questions under the "Discussion" section in your breakout rooms. 

- We'll choose a few rooms to share their conclusions.
